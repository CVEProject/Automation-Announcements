# Automation Announcement
This repository contains CVE Program Automation Announcements that are made at the Automation Working Group meetings concerning the status/upcoming changes to the CVE Program Automation Infrastructure.  CVE Record Suppliers (e.g., CVE Numbering Authorities) and downstream users of CVE vulnerability information housed in the  [CVE Record Repository](https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5) may also find these announcements useful.  Each announcement will be contained in a single Announcement file with the file name YYYYMMDDTitle (where YYYYMMDD reflects the date .. e.g.,20240925 and Title reflects some descriptor of the nature of the announcment)

Announcements will include (but not be limited to):
- Upcoming CVE Record Format Changes
- CVE Services modifications and deployments
- Significant CVE Program Automation Infrastructure status changes

The repository will be used exclusively for Automation Announcements.   The CVE Program Automation Working Group will be the only contributor (as the originator of the Announcements).   Pull Requests, Issues discussions and other community engagement mechanisms will not be enabled.

For those interested in getting these announcements delivered to their email (or mobile device) you are encouraged to monitor this repository using the Github "Watch" feature that can be enabled at the top, right of the repository page (near the "Star" and "Fork" buttons)
