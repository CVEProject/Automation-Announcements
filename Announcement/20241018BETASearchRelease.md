## Release of  BETA CVE Repository Search capability into Testing (i.e, test.cve.org) for Community Review

On Thursday 10/17/2024, we released a BETA version of a future CVE Repository Search capability into the cve.org [testing environment](https://test.cve.org)  for community review and comment.  It adds simple "Term Search" to the already existing CVE ID Lookup capability.  We view this as the first of numerous upcoming improvements to increase the Search/retrieval capability of vulnerability information available in the CVE Repository.  

## Impact 

This affects the [https://test.cve.org](https://test.cve.org) web site and those who use it to review CVE Records that they have submitted through the [CVE Services Testing Instance](https://cveawg-test.mitre.org).

You will notice that the CVE-ID Lookup Box at the top of the page has changed.  Users who wish to review their test records will now need to use the "pull down" menu and select the second option (i.e, *Find a Test CVE Record/ID (Legacy)*) to perform a CVE ID Lookup that pulls data from the CVE Services Testing Instance CVE Repository.

The first pull down option (i.e, *Search CVE List (Beta)*) will retrieve data from the CVE Services PRODUCTION CVE Repository.
 
## Guidance

The legacy option (i.e, 2nd Pull Down option) continues to work as the previous CVE ID Lookup box did.

The Search (Beta) option (i.e., the 1st Pull Down option) will initial the new search capability.   See the new banner at the top of the [https://test.cve.org](https://test.cve.org) for an explanation of the new search (i.e., its scope and limitations)  and instructions on how to provide feedback).
