## Upgraded CVE Repository Key Word Search Deployed to cve.org 

On December 11, 2024, the CVE Program deployed an upgraded CVE List Search capability to cve.org.  This upgrade is the latest in a series of planned modifications to improve CVE List accessibility and ease of use.   It allows users of cve.org to search the CVE list by keywords with letters or numbers (e.g., vendor name, number and hyphens associated with the CVE-ID).  

Future enhancments will include adding the ability to perform searches to include special character (eg., dot(.), forward slash (/) and other enhancements suggested by the community. 

See this announcement for more information. 

## Impact 
There will be no impact to CNAs who are publishing CVE Records or users of the CVE List located in the Github cveV5list repository.   

Users of the cve.org web site search pane (previously used for only single CVE-ID Lookups) can now enter search terms as well as a CVE ID for Look-up.  CVE Record details rendered by clicking on a specific CVE Record in the search result list will present the same CVE Record information as before.    

## Guidance
