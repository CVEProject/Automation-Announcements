## CVE Services Down for Maintenance 4/2/2025

The CVE Program will be performing maintenance on CVE Services on April 2 between 1 and 5 PM EDT. During this time CVE Services will not be available to publish/update CVE Records. 

## Impact 
This maintenance action will have no impact on existing CVE Records in the CVE List.  The V5 CVE List repository will remain available during this time but will not be udpated with newly published/updated records until maintenance is complete.   

## Guidance
It is suggested that CNAs either publish/udpate CVE  well before 1:00 PM EDT or after 5:00 PM EDT to have high confidence of CVE Service availability.    For Downstream users, if you require the most up to date CVE information on April 2, it is suggested that you wait until well after 5:00 PM EDT on that day to allow for publications to "catch up"
