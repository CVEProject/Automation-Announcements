## Test Announcement

This is a test announcement.  If this were a real announcment this section would include the introductory text of the announcement (i.e, what is happening to include date/time of the event).

## Impact 
This section would include the impact (or expected impact) of the announcement.  It should include the who (e.g., CNAs, Downstream users, both) and the what (e.g, CNAs will not be able to post CVE Records from x - y time)

## Guidance
This section would include any appropriate guidance that will help the targetted audience (e.g.,  CNAs should refrain from attempting to post records until the an announcmement noting that the issue has been addressed, or CNA and Downstream users are encouraged to update their tooling to use the new schema)
